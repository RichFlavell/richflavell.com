# 👋 Hello World

## Software Engineer & Outdoor Enthusiast

<br />

I seem to have a natural drive for creativity, be that writing, music production, photography, development… the list goes on.
But I’ve always struggled to define exactly what I’m happy doing most.
The fear of falling into the trap of becoming a “Jack of all trades, master of none” has certainly brought me some levels of anxiety over the years.
It’s only recently that I’ve started to take a step back and re-evaluate what means the most to me. And here is my solution.
This is the place where I’ll be documenting my travels, adventures and self retrospection.

I’ve had the idea of starting a writing platform for some time now, but I’ve never seemed to get round to it.
As the years kept coming and going, and I constantly re-assured myself that I’d get around to it year after year,
I finally managed to kick my own backside and finally, start writing.

By trade, I’m a Software Engineer currently working at [FACEIT](https://www.faceit.com).
I love my job. Programming, for me, is somewhat therapeutic - similar to solving a crossword on a cold winter's day around the crackling fire.
As for how I became a developer, I’m not really sure.
All I know is that I’ve always had a natural ability to solve technical related problems _(Mum if you’re reading this, did you try turning it off and on again?)_.
As I was struggling to find exactly what I wanted to do when I left school, I stumbled into a software course at college, which eventually led to me studying Computer Science at King’s College London.

Music has played a massive role in my life.
Having a Dad who has been playing in bands for as long as I can remember is the reason I believe I’ve been so musically driven.
It was only natural that someday I would want to follow in his footsteps and pickup the guitar; somewhere around my eight birthday, I did.
Throughout my school days l was in and out of bands and somewhere along the way I started exploring electronic music production.
Looking back, I had a fairly successful experience. Somehow I managed to perform overseas and even released some of my music in Japan. I did however have a unhealthy relationship with it all and I think the takeaway here is that when it comes to music, I much prefer being a consumer than a creator. Maybe somewhere down the line my path will lead me back to music.

I’ve always loved photography.
Now, in the era of connectivity where sharing is easier than ever, giving people inspiration and sharing moments with others is something I want to do more of.
Taking video and pictures of adventures is something that 2020 holds for me, so hopefully sometime soon, I will pickup the camera again.

Outside of my hobbies, professions and everything in between I currently reside in London with Beth, my beautiful fiancé, and Tonrar, our dog.
We’re both avid gamers and enjoy getting cosy of the weekends playing through whichever RPG takes our fancy.

_The content in this page will change over time. I’m still learning and growing as a person. Whilst this page serves as a snapshot of my inner-descriptive monologue in the ’now’, I plan to revisit here and keep this page up-to-date when I see fit. Everyone has goals and aspirations, and the world around us is constantly changing, I'd like this page to be constantly changing too._
